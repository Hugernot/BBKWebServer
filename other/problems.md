- Form div takes up 100 screen width
- Password ti's width wont expand (fixed: spelled tiPassword like tiPasword)
- Wont move to the welcome page when sign in is clicked
- Choppy on sign in because of rounded edges
- Make sure that there are no errors in the console
  - Getting an element by ID without throwing an error because the element you are trying to access isn't on the page.

#Notes:
- Bootstrap? Maybe just use \@media to make discrete changes.
- Find out if you can check if JS is enabled
